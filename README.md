### Hey There, I'm Isaac! ðŸ‘‹

I'm in my 3rd year of Computer Science + Cognitive Systems at UBC, in Vancouver, BC.

I'm currently working as a Build Engineer Intern @ Visier, and am an incoming SWE Intern @ Tesla.

I'm passionate about combining tech and communities, creating solutions that better lives.
